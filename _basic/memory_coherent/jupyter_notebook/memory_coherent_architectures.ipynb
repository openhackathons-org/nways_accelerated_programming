    "Memory coherency is a feature where the multiple processes/threads accessing memory must agree on the state of the memory at all times. For example, thread 0 reads the memory location X, and thread 1 reads the same location at the same time, both threads should always read the same value. But if memory is not coherent, threads A and B might read back different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory coherency can be provided natively at the hardware level or emulated at the software level. For example, old GPU architecture from NVIDIA supported memory coherency via Unified Memory using a Heterogeneous Memory Management Module, also referred to as [HMM](https://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2017/presentation/s7764_john-hubbardgpus-using-hmm-blur-the-lines-between-cpu-and-gpu.pdf) feature that use software to emulate memory coherence between CPUs and GPUs. Software-based memory coherency provides its own limitation and is not required in latest generation architectures like Grace Hopper Superchip. The applications transparently benefit from hardware acceleration for memory coherency provided by NVLink-C2C, without any software changes, as described in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main ways to obtain Unified Memory are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fully Supported Unified Memory: Developers allocate memory on the host with system APIs: stack variables, global-/file-scope variables, malloc() / mmap() thread locals, etc.\n",
    "- Managed Unified Memory: Memory allocated using explicit API, for example, cudaMallocManaged(). This provides backward compatibility and is available on more systems, and may perform better than System-Allocated Memory.\n",
